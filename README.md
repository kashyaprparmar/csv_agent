## üìã Key Features Explained

### AI Judge System

The AI Judge is a unique feature that automatically evaluates every data-related response based on:

- **Accuracy**: Correctness of the analysis
- **Completeness**: Sufficiency of information provided
- **Data Usage**: Appropriate use of available data
- **Methodology**: Soundness of analytical approach
- **Clarity**: Understandability of the response

Each response receives:
- ‚úÖ **APPROVED**: High-quality, accurate response
- ‚ùå **REJECTED**: Issues found, needs review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ERROR**: System error occurred
- ‚ùì **UNKNOWN**: Unable to determine quality

### Smart Query Routing

The system intelligently determines query types:
- **Data-related**: Routed to PandasAI agent with judge verification
- **General**: Handled by Gemini chat model
- **Hybrid**: Context-aware processing

### Memory & Performance

- **Conversation Memory**: Agent remembers previous interactions (6 message pairs)
- **Efficient Loading**: Optimized DataFrame processing
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for all failure scenarios

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### Streamlit Configuration

The app includes custom CSS styling and responsive design. You can modify the appearance by editing the CSS in the `st.markdown()` sections.

### Model Configuration

- **Chat Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` (Temperature: 0.7)
- **Judge Model**: Same model with lower temperature (0.1) for consistency
- **Agent Memory**: 6 conversation pairs retained

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Not Working**
